            <p id="myP">The capybara is the largest living rodent, native to South America.
                It is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member
                is the lesser capybara. Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock
                cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla,
                and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives
                near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups
                as large as one hundred individuals, but usually live in groups of 10â€“20 individuals. </p>
